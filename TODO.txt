Test for passing a ShutterSwitcher into DoubleWindowFactory

Make Spy more flexible by adding more assertions, and adding the abbility to string log properties togeter
  eg: view.spy.assertLogged(func).times.2.withArgs([true, false])

Improve the display of test results, remove full path to test classes, add test name to result.
  Might have to fork ASUnit.

System for which DoubleWindow panes to smash is too complex, replace with a different simpler system

Create a class named RNG as a facade for the rest of the random generation classes

Rename RandomBooleanGenerator::boolean() to generate()

Add optional parameter to RandomBooleanGenerator::boolean() to accept a percentage chance of a true output

Change Arrays of Objects to Vectors of specific object types.

Finish testing RandomIntGenerator

Consider outputing fake windows from factory to improve testing in BuildingSegmentTest.

Throw an error when BuildingSegment::getWindowAt() recieves a number over 14.

Rearrange the window indeces so that the first window and first index in both directions are 1 instead of 0.

Extract the concept of a 2 dimentional array into a class and use it for the windows in a BuildingSegment.
